I build projects on such CMS as: modx revolution or wordpress, depending on the tasks. I prefer to code rather than build a constructor in visual editors. I know Joomla but I don't like it. I tasted Laravel, it would be interesting to get a closer look

Due to the fact that I have been working alone for many years, I know little about teamwork, I am superficially familiar with trello, jira, git etc.

If there is an urgent need and motivation, I can study any technology, perfectionism and curiosity will help me with this.
